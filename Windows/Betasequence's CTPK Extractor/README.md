## How to use
Give a file as an argument to process a single file: 

 `python3 read.py example.bin`

Or give a directory of files as an argument to process all the files in the directory: 

 `python3 read.py ExampleFiles`

 The split files will be placed in a subdirectory with the name of the file concatenated with "_images". e.g. "example.bin_images".
